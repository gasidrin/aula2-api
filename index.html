        <p>All modern websites and web applications are built using three fundamental technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the web.</p>
        
        <p>In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about, and why you too should learn it.</p>
        
        <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
        
        <p>HTML stands for <b>HyperText Markup Language</b>. It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language).</p>
        
        <p>HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.</p>
        
        <h3>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Opening tag</li>
            <br>
            <li>The closing tag</li>
            <br>
            <li>The actual element</li>
            <br>
            <p>You can learn more at the MDN Web Docs.</p>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why should you learn HTML?</h2>
        
        <h3>There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the web. Here are 5 of them:</h3>
        
        <ol>
        <li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li>
        <li>To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like Worpress or Wix</li>
        <li>To build web applications</li>
        <li>To impress friends</li>
        <li>To have fun ðŸ˜ƒ
        </ol>
        
        <p>Hopefully you learned something new here. See you next time!</p>
